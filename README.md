# Snake Game 🐍

Built the classic snake game in React, using `<div></div>`, `scss` React Context and React hooks:

## Game Play
![Gameplau](/src/assets/game.gif)

## Need for Improvement
1. currently `<div></div>` are used to render the game's UI, this can be optimized by using `<canvas></canvas>`

2. A debouncer needs to be implemented during keypress (Directions).
